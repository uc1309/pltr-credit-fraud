Repository for ECMA 31330 final project.

Dumitrescu, et al. (2021) present a new method, named penalized logistic tree regression (PLTR) for discrimative modelling of data with threshold effects. PLTR aims to combine the accuracy of random forests with the ease of interpretability in logistic regression. Dumitrescu, et al. (2021) illustrated the competitive accuracy and interpretability of PLTR in credit scoring, a data with well-known threshold effects. This work aims to demonstrate the robustness of PLTR for modelling threshold effects by implementing PLTR for a different problem, fraud detection. Monte Carlo simulation of credit card transaction data provided evidence for the existence of threshold effects, and the potential for improved accuracy and reliable interpretability with PLTR. The simulated results were backed by experiments on real data, with PLTR outperforming random forest and logistic regression, and identifying several bivariate threshold effects with significant marginal effects on fraud detection.
